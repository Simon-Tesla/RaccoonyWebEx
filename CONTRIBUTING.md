# Contributing code

As you've undoubtably noticed, Raccoony updates have been fairly sparse lately. If you're familiar with Javascript/Typescript and have an interest in browser extension development, I welcome contributions.

The [wiki](https://github.com/Simon-Tesla/RaccoonyWebEx/wiki) contains additional documentation that you may find helpful.

[TODO: add overview of Raccoony's architecture, links to documentation]

## Don't have an idea?

I've marked several issues with the [good first issue](https://github.com/Simon-Tesla/RaccoonyWebEx/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) and [help wanted](https://github.com/Simon-Tesla/RaccoonyWebEx/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) tags. You are more than welcome to chime in with contributions on these issues.

Bugfixes are *always* welcome.

## Have an idea for a new feature?
Awesome! My main request is that you start by filing a feature request issue and please make sure to mention in that issue that you'd like to contribute the code for it. This allows a chance to weigh in on the feature and make sure that it's a good fit for Raccoony and help guide the implementation to something that will fit well and work well. Once your feature has been approved by a maintainer (currently just Simon) you can start working on your implementation.

## Getting the code into Raccoony
Due to the hassle of pretty much any other mechanism for code contributions, I only accept code contributions via Pull Requests (with the possible exception of very minor bugfixes). All pull requests must have an issue associated with them so that any discussion on the issue or PR can be easily tracked.

Happy coding!
