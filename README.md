# Raccoony! ![Raccoony logo][logo]

**Now with 100% more WebExtension goodness™**

A web extension for Firefox and Chrome that adds shiny new features (like automatic downloading) to art sites. 
Inspired by the [FurAffinity Extender](https://andrewneo.github.io/faextender/) and [Inkbunny Downloader](http://www.humbird0.com/#/addons/inkbunny_downloader) Firefox addons.

See the [official website][website] for announcements.

This README is a work in progress.

## Features
- Download submissions from art sites
- Open all submissions in a gallery/notifications in tabs (with a timed delay)
- Show pictures in a "full-screen" view that covers the entire page (and optionally enter this view automatically)
- Hotkey support for downloading, opening in tabs and fullscreen
- Supported sites: deviantArt, e621, Eka's Portal (contributed by Eupeptic), FurAffinity, Furry Network, HicceArs, InkBunny, Patreon, Shorpy.com (contributed by Eupeptic), SoFurry, and Weasyl.

See the TODO list below for more planned features.

## Download & Install
